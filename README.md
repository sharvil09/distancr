# distancr

Thank you for your interest in our work. You can acccess the most recent version of the tool at https://sharvil09.shinyapps.io/Distance_v2/.

For use of the app, just type in which store you want to go to, your zip code, and how far you are willing to travel (in miles). Then the relevant results will be returned on the map and in the table. The covid score indicates the level of risk associated with a specific location and the red values indicate above average risk while green values indiicate below average risk. You can also expand specific rows to find the best day, on average, to go where a lower number is better.
